# SevilleMask

If a mask does not fit well around your face (creating a reasonable seal) then it is not going to do a good job. Period.

Most homemade masks have a terrible seal. Either they have big gaps on the cheeks, nose, or under the chin or they have a seam that runs right over the middle of the nose and mouth. Sometimes both. Every seam is a point of failure!

It is a catch-22, you need seams in order to create a good fit but seams let unfiltered air in and out. Compromises must be made, but in my opinion a seam should *never* run down the center of the nose and mouth where the bulk of the air is pulled through the mask. It creates totally unnecessary risk.

Most masks are not very attractive. Safety is first of course but everyone wants to look nice. People are more likely to wear a mask if it makes them look more like a superhero and less like an extra from an episode of Scrubs.

That is why I made this mask pattern, so that people making masks at home would have an option for a better fitting, safer design that looks more like fashion and less like a really scary pandemic. For free.

Huge thanks to everyone who has supported this project through gifts of their time, skills, money, and "likes"!

Features of my pattern:

The mask is tight against the skin all the way around the edges. No gaps!

Lots of room in front of the mouth. Lips should never touch the inside of a mask!

Pocket for removable filter (optional)

More face coverage = more germ protection. Germs land on the mask instead of your skin. Take it off when you get home and pop it in the wash.

Shaping is done with darts instead of piecing to minimize seam length. Seams are in areas where the mask sits tight against the face minimizing the amount of air leakage.

Uses either fold over elastic or bias tape, both of which are much easier to get than standard mask elastics. Can be made with either ear loops or behind the head loops/ties.
(Mask making has caused a significant elastic shortage in the US, among other supplies.)

More stylish than most!

The pattern for my first size is finished! No single mask pattern will fit everyone. Scot was my fit model for the first size. His face is an average size for a Caucasian cis-male and he has a short beard.

We are working on pdf patterns as quickly as we can. In the meantime I took a few photos of the pattern on a grid in case there was someone who needs to start work on their masks now. There is undoubtedly some lens distortion but it will give experienced folks a solid jumping off point. I will post them in the comments. (This text was from a facebook post. These photos will be checked in to this repository)

How can you help?
